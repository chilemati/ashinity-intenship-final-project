# 🛒 Full E-Commerce Website

This is my **Ashinity Internship Final Project**, an e-commerce web application built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**.  
The project implements a modern shopping experience inspired by a [Figma community design](https://www.figma.com/design/T8wi5XpDx1Zso0c5wuVRhF/Full-E-Commerce-Website-UI-UX-Design--Community-?node-id=34-213&t=JesBGGS9OfcTnbPS-0).  

The app is designed with clean UI/UX, optimized performance, and scalable architecture suitable for real-world e-commerce platforms.
